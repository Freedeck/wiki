# Setting up Freedeck

This page will fully guide you through setting up your Freedeck!

## Using the App

Start by clicking "Launch Freedeck" in the App.

You'll be greeted by the splash screen on Freedeck Companion.

Once it finishes, you'll see a beautifully smooth transition into the app where the splash window resizes.

Here, you're greeted by the Audio Setup screen. Pick your monitor device and VB-Cable, which you can click the link in Companion to download.

When you set the devices, click "Next" to save them.

Pick your other device (phone, tablet, etc...)'s operating system, and click Connection Instructions.

You do not need to hide this code, because it's a reference to your local IP. (192.168.x.x).

However, due to this, your other device (phone, tablet, etc...) needs to be on the same network as your computer.

To connect, follow the on-screen instructions.

The code is not case-sensitive.

Here's what your other device's screen should show.

</center>

Once you connect the other device, your screen will automatically transition to the main Companion screen.

From now on, you will never see that setup flow again, but instead if your device isn't connected, a small prompt on the left sidebar.

<center>

  This is what that prompt will look like. Clicking it will open the Pair Device screen.
</center>

## Setup Complete!

You've now fully setup Freedeck!
