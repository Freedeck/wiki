## Freewiki

Freewiki is an experimental Markdown -> HTML converter that generates a live site on demand, and a static site for re-usability.

It uses it's own variable system to handle dynamic-like data alongside a for-loop-like handler.

This entire wiki is built on Freewiki.

Freewiki is still a work in progress.</p>
