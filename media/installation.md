# Installing Freedeck

This page will fully guide you through installing Freedeck!

</center>

## Using the App

- First, download the App from [freedeck.app](https://freedeck.app)

- Run the installer
  - If you get a Windows SmartScreen error, ignore it and press More Info then Run Anyway. This is because I don't pay for Windows code-signing.
- Once you see this, click "Install"

  - If you get prompted to install Git & Node.js, go through those installers!

- When the installer finishes, the App will automagically transform into the actual launcher.
