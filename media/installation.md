# Installing Freedeck

The installation guide begins here!

</center>

## Using the App

- First, download the App from [freedeck.app](https://freedeck.app)
  - [If you need, click here for a direct download link from GitHub.](https://github.com/Freedeck/app/releases/latest/download/Freedeck.exe)

- Run the App
  - If you get a Windows SmartScreen error, ignore it and press More Info then Run Anyway. This is because I don't pay for Windows code-signing.
  - It may take more than a second for the App to start, as it has to load every library it self-contains.
- Once you see this, click "Install"

- If you want, you can customize your install by going to the Settings tab.

- Now, wait for the installation to finish!
  - If you get prompted to install Git and/or Node.js, go through those installers. Freedeck will automatically continue when those installations finish and close.

- When the installer finishes, the App will automagically transform into the actual launcher.
