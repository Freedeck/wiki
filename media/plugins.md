# Installing Plugins

There's 2 ways of installing plugins, and 3 types of plugins.

Plugin types:

- Single File (limited)
- Source Folder (raw source code, uncompressed, slightly limited)
- .Freedeck file (ASAR bundle, uncompressed, fully supported)
- .fdpackage file (.tar.gz bundle, uncompressed, fully supported)

On this page, I'll just be going over the .fdpackage files, as they're easiest to understand.

[If you want a technical explanation of both the .Freedeck and .fdpackage type, or even creating plugins, this is the page to go to.](/plugins_extended)

## Marketplace

The Marketplace allows you to easily download plugins from official or community repositories.

## Requirements

To download *any* plugin from the built-in Marketplace, you must have Handoff installed.

## Installing a Plugin

- Click *Marketplace* on the right sidebar in the Freedeck desktop app.
- Find a plugin you like!
- Click Download!
- If Freedeck exits, that's normal. Just start it again!
  - Sometimes installing a plugin causes the reload process to need to restart.
- The plugin is now installed.

## Checking if a Plugin is installed

- Click *Plugins* on the right sidebar in the Freedeck desktop app.
- There will be a list of plugins.
- If you don't see the name of the plugin you just downloaded, you may need to reload the plugin list.
  - This is done by clicking *Reload All Plugins*.

## What are all these buttons?

All of the buttons you see on the *Plugins* page is every type that a tile can be.

## Disabling/Enabling Plugins

- Scroll down on the *Plugins* page

- That plugin has been disabled!

To enable a plugin,

- Scroll down on the *Plugins* page
- Press "Enable (plugin name)"
